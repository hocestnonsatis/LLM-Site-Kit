## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub Issues.**

If you believe you have found a security issue (e.g. in the MCP server, file reading / AST parsing pipeline, agent request handling, or any other part of the codebase), please report it privately so we can address it before public disclosure.

1. **Email** the details to: **security@example.com**  
   *(Replace with your project’s security contact before publishing.)*

2. Include:
   - A short description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce (if possible)
   - Impact and suggested severity (e.g. low / medium / high / critical)
   - Your name/handle for acknowledgment (optional)

3. We will acknowledge receipt within a reasonable time and will work with you to understand and fix the issue. We may ask for more information or suggest a coordinated disclosure date.

4. We ask that you allow us a reasonable period to address the report before any public disclosure.

We appreciate the security research community’s efforts to help keep LLM-Site-Kit and its users safe.
